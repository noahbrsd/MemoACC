# MemoACC
Small project that allows you to store notes on the players you meet in multiplayer.  
This project is for private purposes only.  
Command to build the projet ``` dotnet build ProjetACC.sln```  
To start the projet use the command ```dotnet run --project waveform\waveform.csproj```   
When you add a note at a player who has already a note, the old one will be overwritten by the new one.  
To do the projet, I use some code from Race-Element: (link: https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element/blob/dev/Race_Element.Broadcast/ACCUdpRemoteClient.cs)
